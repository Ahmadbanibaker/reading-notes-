# HTML & CSS Design and Build Websites JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY

## 1- Structuring Word Documents
* HTML Describes the Structure 
of Pages.
* HTML Uses Elements
to Describe the 
Structure of Pages.
* Tags act like containers. They tell you 
something about the information that lies 
between their opening and closing tags.
* Attributes provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
separated by an equals sign.

## Head , Body & Title 
* head : Before the <body> element you 
will often see a <head> element. 
This contains information 
about the page (rather than 
information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in 
blue on the opposite page). 
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.
* body : Everything inside this element is 
shown inside the main browser 
window.
* title : The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the 
top of the browser, above where 
you usually type in the URL of 
the page you want to visit, or 
on the tab for that page (if your 
browser uses tabs to allow you 
to view multiple pages at the 
same time).
## Headings 
![headings](https://programmingbasics.in/contents/languages/html/images/headings.jpg)
## Paragraphs
To create a paragraph, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening 
tag and closing  tag.
By default, a browser will show 
each paragraph on a new line 
with some space between it and 
any subsequent paragraphs.

* Bold : By enclosing words in the tags 
<b> and </b> we can make 
characters appear bold .
* Italic : By enclosing words in the tags 
<i> and </i> we can make 
characters appear italic.
* sup : The <sup> element is used 
to contain characters that 
should be superscript such 
as the suffixes of dates or 
mathematical concepts like 
raising a number to a power.
* sub : The <sub> element is used to 
contain characters that should 
be subscript. It is commonly 
used with foot notes or chemical 
formulas such as H2O.
* ol : Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is 
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for 
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
where each point needs to be identified by a section 
number. Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening <li tag 
and a closing </li tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

* ul : The unordered list is created 
with the <ul element.Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening <li tag 
and a closing </li tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
* img : To add an image into the page 
you need to use an <img
element. This is an empty 
element (which means there is 
no closing tag). It must carry the 
following two attributes: src
This tells the browser where 
it can find the image file. This 
will usually be a relative URL 
pointing to an image on your 
own site. (Here you can see that 
the images are in a child folder 
called images ,alt
This provides a text description 
of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it.
* Basic Table Structure : 
The <table element is used 
to create a table. The contents 
of the table are written out row 
by row. <tr You indicate the start of each 
row using the opening <tr tag. 
(The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more <td elements (one for each cell 
in that row). 
At the end of the row you use a 
closing </tr tag . 
The <th element is used just 
like the <td element but its 
purpose is to represent the 
heading for either a column or 
a row. (The th stands for table 
heading ).
  ## 2 - JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY
  ![javascript](https://coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/rich/rich_files/rich_files/4783/original/5-javascript-terms-for-beginners.png)
* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered 
before creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more 
than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
