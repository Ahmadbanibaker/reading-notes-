# Functions
- ### A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

### Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
### Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
1. ## Function declarations :
- The name of the function
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

2. ## Function expressions
#### Such a function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name.However, a name can be provided with a function expression. Providing a name allows the function to refer to itself, and also makes it easier to identify the function in a debugger's stack traces
