# What Is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component subclasses: We’ll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.

### Note

In JavaScript classes, you need to always call super when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a super(props) call.

### Note

We split the returned element into multiple lines for readability, and added parentheses so that JavaScript doesn’t insert a semicolon after return and break our code.

### Note

The DOM <button> element’s onClick attribute has a special meaning to React because it is a built-in component. For custom components like Square, the naming is up to you. We could give any name to the Square’s onClick prop or Board’s handleClick method, and the code would work the same. In React, it’s conventional to use on[Event] names for props which represent events and handle[Event] for the methods which handle the events.

## Why Immutability Is Important

In the previous code example, we suggested that you create a copy of the squares array using the slice() method instead of modifying the existing array. We’ll now discuss immutability and why immutability is important to learn.

There are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to mutate the data by directly changing the data’s values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes.

### Function Components

We’ll now change the Square to be a function component.

In React, function components are a simpler way to write components that only contain a render method and don’t have their own state. Instead of defining a class which extends React.Component, we can write a function that takes props as input and returns what should be rendered. Function components are less tedious to write than classes, and many components can be expressed this way.

### Warning

Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.

For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.

### Tip

We recommend using the “Babel” language definition for your editor of choice so that both ES6 and JSX code is properly highlighted.

## Rendering an Element into the DOM

We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render().

### Note

In practice, most React apps only call ReactDOM.render() once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into stateful components.

We recommend that you don’t skip topics because they build on each other.

## Function and Class Components

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

### Note: Always start component names with a capital letter

React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, <div > represents an HTML div tag, but <Welcome /> represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.
