# HTML & CSS Design
## Chapter 16: Images
* Controlling sizes of
images in CSS
You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.
Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.
* Centering images
Using CSS 
By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.
Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:
1: On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
* background-image
The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.
The path to the image follows
the letters url, and it is put
inside parentheses and quotes.
* background-position
When an image is not being
repeated, you can use the
background-position
property to specify where in the
browser window the background
image should be placed.
This property usually has a pair
of values. The first represents
the horizontal position and the
second represents the vertical.
* Image Rollovers 
& Sprites
Using CSS, it is possible to create
a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves
their mouse over it (known as a
rollover) and a third style when
they click on it.
This is achieved by setting a
background image for the link or
button that has three different
styles of the same button (but
only allows enough space to
show one of them at a time).
You can see the image we are
using in this example on the
right. It actually features two
buttons on the one image.
### summary 
* You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.
* Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.

* You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page. 
* Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.
* You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.
* To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.

## Chapter 19: Practical Information
* Search Engine
Optimization (SEO)
SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.
The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can
improve your website's visibility on search engines.
* On-Page SEO 
In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability.
* How to Identify
Keywords and Phrases
Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.
* Analytics: Learning
about your Visitors
As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by
Google called Google Analytics.
* How Many People Are
Coming to Your Site?
The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are
likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are
coming to your site.
### summary 
* Search engine optimization helps visitors find your
sites when using search engines.
* Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to
see how many people visit your site, how they find it,
and what they do when they get there.

* To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a
domain name and web hosting.
* FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server.
* Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
