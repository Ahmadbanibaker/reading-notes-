# EASILY CREATE STUNNING ANIMATED CHARTS WITH CHART.JS
* Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.
* Drawing a line chart 
To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of our HTML page,Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element.
* Drawing a bar chart
Finally, let’s add  a bar chart to our page. Happily the syntax for the bar chart is very similar to the line chart we’ve already added. First, we add the canvas element,Next, we retrieve the element and create the graph,And finally, we add in the bar chart’s data.
* The < canvas> element :
At first sight a < canvas> looks like the < img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the < canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.
* Drawing shapes with canvas :
Now that we have set up our canvas environment, we can get into the details of how to draw on the canvas. By the end of this article, you will have learned how to draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves, providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. Working with paths is essential when drawing objects onto the canvas and we will see how that can be done.
* Applying styles and colors :
In the chapter about drawing shapes, we used only the default line and fill styles. Here we will explore the canvas options we have at our disposal to make our drawings a little more attractive. You will learn how to add different colors, line styles, gradients, patterns and shadows to your drawings.
* Drawing text :
After having seen how to apply styles and colors in the previous chapter, we will now have a look at how to draw text onto the canvas.
